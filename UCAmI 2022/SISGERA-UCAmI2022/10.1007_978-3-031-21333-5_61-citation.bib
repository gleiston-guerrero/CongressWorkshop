abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming our society and even the way people interact with their environment. In an IoT-based system (IoTS), the identification, authentication and authorization of people and objects is especially important to be able to avoid privacy and security issues. This paper presents an IoTS to control access to classrooms and to efficiently manage their resources (lights and electric/electronic devices). Since the professor scheduled to teach a lesson at a given moment is the only authorized person to open the classroom door, this IoTS identifies that professor through facial recognition, considering a pre-established classroom schedule. In addition, RFID or fingerprint authentication are used to register the attendance of students to each lesson. To develop this IoTS, TDDM4IoTS (Test-Driven Development Methodology for IoT-based Systems) was used. This methodology encourages user engagement during the IoTS development. In fact, professors were involved from the very beginning, especially to improve the design of the mobile application interfaces, finally achieving 100{\%} acceptance by them.",
